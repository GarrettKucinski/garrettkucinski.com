Most of us want better lives, and most of us are perpetually unsure of how to motivate ourselves day in and day out to do the things that will get us where we want to go. In the book Atomic Habits author James Clear lays out a framework for building habits that will help you achieve your goals.

## Who Should Read this Book?
The answer to this is simple: everyone. The book is written almost as a manual for getting the things you want out of life. No matter who you are or what you want, we are all the product of our habits, the small actions we take everyday that compound over time. Change your habits, change your life.

If any of the following apply I highly recommend you read this book
- You genuinely want a playbook for acheiving more of your goals
- You are interested in how habits are formed and how to change them
- You are interested in how to motivate yourself
- You want to learn how to build systems that will carry you to your goals

## Favorite Quotes by The Author
- “You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.”
- “Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.”
- “The purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game.”
- “The more pride you have in a particular aspect of your identity, the more motivated you will be to maintain the habits associated with it.”
- “The most effective form of motivation is progress.”
- Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results.

## The Four Laws of Behavior Change
1.  **Make it obvious** -
Behavior change often strikes people as something super arduous and uncomfortable, but it doesn't have to be. In fact, the easier you make it for yourself to do the things you want to do, the more likely you are to do them. Basically if you want to go to the gym, put your gym clothes out the night before, if you want to read more put a book on your pillow. The easier you make it for yourself to automatically do the things you want to do, the more likely you are to do them. In the case of the book, you might go to bed with a few extra minutes and instead of browsing instagram until you fall asleep you instead say "Well, I have a book right here, I might as well read a few pages." 
2. **Make it attractive** - When a habit is unattractive, perhaps unsurprisingly you are less likely to want to do whatever it is. Though you can't change that habit you want to form, you can change your perception of it. I've always wanted to be ripped as well as the kind of person who works out regularly and enjoys it. So for me, it helped starting out two days a week working out at home. This made it obivious because it was right where I was already. I made it attractive by eliminating the need to go to a gym or buy equipment. And, leading into the next law, it made it easy by reducing the friction between me and the habit. I didn't have to go anywhere, I didn't have to buy anything, I just had to do it.
3. **Make it easy** - As I mentiond above with my work out habit, this law is all about making it as easy as possible to follow through on the thing you want yourself to do. In my case eliminating the need to go anywhere or own any equipment meant that the only barrier left was just doing the thing. If we can make our habits as easy as possible and reduce as much friction as we can, we are less likely to be able to come up with excuses to not do them.
4. **Make it satisfying** - Our brain is wired to want immediate returns. So the more we can reward ourselves immediately after doing the difficult habit we are trying to form the more likely we are to stick with it going forward. This can take many forms and just needs to be something that will give you a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction.
